# Water-Level-Detector
As part of the course module EN1190 Engineering Design Project, we were given to make a project and demonstrate that. We have started this project in the beginning of the semester 02. We planned to make a water level sensor to get alert about the water level in tanks to avoid the problems due to the water.After that we have worked together throughout that entire semester and now we have finished that completely. Now our project is ready to demonstration. We selected to use Atmega328P micro controller. Then we analyzed the all feasibilities and all possibilities. The Design of PCB and Enclosure was done using Altium software and Solid works software respectively. This report is written in order to explain the functionality, how we approach and implement to achieve the desired task, important issues faced during the project progress and the solution we came up.

## Introduction
* In some households, there are water tanks located in their backyards, which can be quite far from the main house. This distance makes it challenging to hear when the tank is overflowing from inside the house. As a result, when they turn on the water pump, they must go closer to the tank and wait until they hear the sound of water overflowing. Only then can they rush to switch off the pump.

* Imagine if they could monitor the water tank’s status from inside the house. This would allow them to easily control the water pump without the need to go outside. Additionally, in cases where they are occupied with work or other activities, receiving notifications about the water level would enable them to turn off the pump at the right time and prevent overflow.


## Solution
We propose a solution to effectively address these concerns. Our plan involves designing a system capable of monitoring the water level in the tank and providing continuous notifications to the user 24/7. This device will be securely fixed on top of the water tank and will incorporate an ultrasound wave generator and receiver.
